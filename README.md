### üöó Overview

AtliQ Motors, a USA-based automotive giant, is looking to expand its electric and hybrid vehicle market in India. With a market share of less than 2% in India, the company's chief for the India region, Bruce Haryali, assigned the data analytics team to conduct a detailed market study to evaluate the current state of the EV/Hybrid market.

Peter Pandey, a data analyst on the team, was tasked with this project. This analysis covers various aspects of the EV market for the fiscal years 2022 to 2024, including:

- Top and bottom makers for 2-wheeler sales
- Penetration rates in different states
- EV sales trends by quarter
- Revenue projections
